# PcVue-Support
This repository includes my libraries designed to facilitate development within the PcVue environment for SCADA. I have created a set of functions to assist developers in efficiently creating variables and expressions.

Welcome to my repository. I trust that my functions will prove valuable to you in your PcVue platform development. These functions provide a streamlined approach to creating variables and expressions, designed with the intention of simplifying and expediting the development process. Although initially developed for my specific needs, feel free to modify and adapt them to suit your own objectives.

One noteworthy feature is the expression, which is specifically tailored for accessing individual bits within a word. This approach enables the utilization of a single I/O slot (word) to import up to 16 bits from an external device, eliminating the need to consume 16 separate I/O slots.

Feel free to explore, modify, and make the most of these functions to enhance your development experience with PcVue. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
